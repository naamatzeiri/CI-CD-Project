# SelaProject - Node.js
A simple JavaScript application running on a docker container, that prints "AM ISRAEL HAI!" on the screen.

- Runs the Node.js setups on the latest version.
- Adds a simple test to ensure the endpoint returns the correct response.
- Build the Docker image for a Node.js application stored in this git repository, and push it to the Docker hub repository.
